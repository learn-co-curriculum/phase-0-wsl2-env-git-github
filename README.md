# Configuring Git and GitHub on WSL2

## Create a GitHub Account

To work on and get credit for the labs and lessons that you do during the
program, you will need to sign up for a GitHub account _if you don't already
have one_.

### Action Item

1. Open the [GitHub signup webpage][] at https://github.com/join
2. Fill out the form and create your account
3. Verify the email address connected to your GitHub account

[github signup webpage]: https://github.com/join

### Check Your Work

If you were able to verify your email address, continue below.

## Configure Git and GitHub

[Git][git] is the tool that we'll use to download and upload the work we do in
labs and lessons. To use Git without signing in every time, you can create a
Secure Shell (SSH) key and associate that to your GitHub account. You will also
need to run a few commands to make sure that when you use Git, you get the
proper credit for your work. This step will ask you to do work both in your
browser and your terminal.

### Action Item: Update Git

1. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
2. Type `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa` and press `<Enter>` to add a
   package repository for downloading the latest version of Git. Follow the
   prompts in the terminal.
3. Type `sudo apt update` and press `<Enter>` to update your local repository cache
4. Type `sudo apt install git` and press `<Enter>` to install the latest version
   of Git

### Check Your Work

You can check your work by typing `git --version` in the terminal. You should
see a version greater than 2.33.0.

### Action Item: Configure Git

1. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
2. Type `git config --global color.ui true` and press `<Enter>`
3. Type `git config --global user.name` + `<Space>` + your name and press
   `<Enter>` _(Note: this should be your full name, not your GitHub username, in
   quotes.)_
4. Type `git config --global user.email` + `<Space>` + the email address you
   used to sign up to GitHub and press `<Enter>`
5. Type `git config --global init.defaultBranch main` to
   [update the default branch name][] to `main`
6. Type `ssh-keygen` and press `<Enter>`. For each prompt **do not type
   anything**, just continue to press `<Enter>`. It's particularly important
   that you **do not enter a passphase**; you should leave the passphrase empty
   when prompted. If you enter a passphrase here, you'll have to enter it every
   time you interact with GitHub (which will happen a lot during the program).
   You may also run into issues submitting assignments later.
7. Type `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip.exe` and press `<Enter>`. This will copy
   your SSH key to your clipboard
8. Open the [GitHub New SSH key form][ssh form]
   (https://github.com/settings/ssh/new) _(Note: you need to be logged in to
   GitHub to access that link.)_
9. Type "My personal PC" in the "Title" input field
10. Paste what's on your clipboard from step seven in the "Key" input field
11. Click "Add SSH Key"

[ssh form]: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
[update the default branch name]: https://github.com/github/renaming

If you see your new SSH key beneath the "SSH keys" heading, continue to the next
lesson, **Verify and Troubleshoot Your WSL2 Environment Setup**.
